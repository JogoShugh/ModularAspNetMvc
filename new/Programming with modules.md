# What is a module?

Before we even start talking about concepts like test-driven development, behavior-driven development, 
or any of the ideas from domain-driven design and the latest hotnes, Command and Query Responsibility Segregation 
(CQRS), we need some lessons on modularity.

A great definition of a modular programming comes from Wikipedia:

```text
Modular programming (also called "top-down design" and "stepwise refinement") is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality.[1] Conceptually, modules represent a separation of concerns, and improve maintainability by enforcing logical boundaries between components. Modules are typically incorporated into the program through interfaces.[2] A module interface expresses the elements that are provided and required by the module. The elements defined in the interface are detectable by other modules. The implementation contains the working code that corresponds to the elements declared in the interface.
